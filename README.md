# Introduction
This is a bot for [reddit](http://www.reddit.com), meant to automate
straightforward moderation tasks by automatically performing actions
based on defined conditions.

I run it using a cronjob that checks through the list of subreddits
every 5 minutes, but it would also be possible to run in an infinite
loop, so that each subreddit is checked as often as possible.

# Requirements
* [mellort / bboe's reddit api wrapper](https://github.com/mellort/reddit_api)
  - at least version 1.2.4
* Flask (for future web interface)
* Flask-SQLAlchemy
* BeautifulSoup

# Setup
Copy modbot.cfg.example to modbot.cfg and edit values to match your
desired database and reddit account. You can have SQLAlchemy create
the tables for you by importing models.py into a Python interpreter
session and calling `db.create_all()`.

# Condition Examples
*Coming soon, will show examples of conditions the bot uses.*
